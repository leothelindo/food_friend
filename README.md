created by Girum Tihtina, Maurice Landers III, Leonardo Lindo

Food Friend is your friend to ordering food online for delivery cheaply and quickly. Food Friend uses React Native so that it is compatible with Android and iOS and uses React Navigation throughout the app. We also use the Yelp API to get information on the restaurants and create our view to display them all in a list. The app is run on Expo.

## Steps to Run

1. install expo
2. install npm (npm install or npm -i)
3. clone the project
4. in the terminal go into project and run "expo start"
5. use expo mobile app to view (might need an account)
